# Linear-Bandits
This repo contains a notebook `algorithms.ipynb` which implements the following bandit algorithms:

- OFUL where the action space is the d-dimensional closed ball
- OFUL where the action space is a discrete set
- UCB where the action space is a discrete set

There are some basic imports in the first cell of `algorithms.ipynb`. After installing these libraries, you should be able to run each cell in the notebook sequentially without issues to run the simulations and reproduce the plots.
